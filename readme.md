# amber scripts

this is a collection of small utility scripts i use to make common tasks easier. current prereqs are python3 and bash.

make some symlinks from here into your ~/.local/bin folder or wherever else you have PATH pointed and you'll be able to run these from anywhere (i'll set up a makefile at some point i promise). you might also have to chmod +x them
